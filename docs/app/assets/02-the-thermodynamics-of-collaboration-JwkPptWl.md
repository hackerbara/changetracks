## The Entropy Problem

Every collaboration system is an **entropy management device**.

### Heat Death of Codebases

When all the original authors leave, and the reasoning is lost, and the code becomes "legacy"—that's maximum entropy. No one can modify it without risk. The system becomes frozen.

This is the fate of most long-lived software:
- Knowledge dissipates (authors leave, memories fade)
- Context evaporates (Slack threads deleted, PRs closed, docs outdated)
- Fear accumulates ("don't touch that, nobody knows how it works")
- Velocity drops to zero

### Changedown as Negentropy Engine

Changedown preserves information (reasoning, intent, deliberation) that would otherwise dissipate. The footnotes are **local reductions in entropy**—pockets of order that persist over time.

When you write:
```markdown
Retry on failure. with exponential backoff

[^cn-1]: @author 2026-02-10 | proposed | ins
    Avoid hammering the API after transient errors.
```

You're not just recording a change. You're creating a **negentropy pocket**—a region of lower entropy (higher order) that resists the natural tendency toward chaos.

## The Second Law Always Wins

Here's the twist: **entropy cannot be destroyed, only managed**.

Eventually, even Changedown files reach heat death:
- Comments get stale
- Context drifts
- Authors referenced no longer exist
- The reasoning no longer applies to current code

The file becomes an archaeological site so complex that reading it costs more energy than rewriting it.

This is the "rot" we worry about. It's not a bug—it's **physics**.

## VCS Compaction as Entropy Export

The genius of the VCS compaction model is that it doesn't fight entropy—it **channels it**.

You're not destroying information. You're moving it to a lower-energy state (git history) where it can exist without interfering with current operations.

Schematic (not a code excerpt):

```text
Before compaction (high entropy, active system):
File with 1000 lines of code + 500 lines of stale footnotes
Reading requires parsing irrelevant historical deliberation

After compaction (lower entropy, clean system):
File with 1000 lines of code + 50 lines of active footnotes
Git history contains the 450 lines of exported entropy
Available if needed, invisible if not
```

## The Real Question

The question isn't "can we prevent entropy?" 

It's: **"Can we manage the rate of entropy increase such that useful work remains possible?"**

### Dynamic Equilibrium

A healthy Changedown file has **dynamic equilibrium**:
- New deliberation enters (fresh entropy reduction)
- Stale deliberation exits (entropy export via compaction)
- The system remains comprehensible
- Useful work continues

### Entropy Accumulation

An unhealthy file has **entropy accumulation**:
- Deliberation enters
- Nothing leaves
- Complexity grows monotonically
- Eventually: file abandonment (heat death)

## The Designer's Job

Your job as designer: Create the tools and norms that let teams find their **equilibrium point**.

Some teams run **hot**:
- High deliberation
- Frequent compaction
- Rich institutional memory
- High maintenance cost

Some teams run **cool**:
- Minimal annotation
- Let VCS handle history
- Clean files
- Lower context preservation

Both are valid thermodynamic states. The error is pretending there's one right answer.

## The Sandwich Connection

A bánh mì has about 10 minutes of optimal consumption window.

Then:
- The bread gets soggy
- The pickles lose crunch
- The magic dissipates

**You have to eat it now.**

Changedown deliberation is similar—it has a **half-life**:
- Active threads are crisp and valuable (fresh bánh mì)
- Stale threads are soggy bread (compaction needed)
- Abandoned threads are mold (abandon file)

The wisdom is knowing when to:
- **Eat** (use the deliberation while fresh)
- **Compost** (export to VCS when stale)
- **Abandon** (rewrite when heat death arrives)

## The Bánh mì Architecture

The bánh mì revelation from our conversation:

> "Do I want to go get sandwiches? Is one question. Do I want to go get bánh mì? Is another always yes kind of question."

This is **category error as feature**.

Bánh mì transcends sandwichness. It creates its own ontology:

1. **Fusion by Design:** French baguette (colonial infrastructure) + Vietnamese flavors (local adaptation) = something neither could create alone

2. **Intentional Contrasts:** Pickled daikon (sharp) + rich pork (fatty) + fresh cilantro (bright) + jalapeño (heat) + mayo (creamy). Each bite has **all five dimensions**.

3. **Messy but Structural:** A bánh mì falls apart as you eat it. That's not failure—that's honest complexity. The paper wrapper catches the debris. The debris is data. The wrapper is VCS.

4. **Globally Portable, Locally Specific:** You can get bánh mì in Paris, Saigon, or Brooklyn. Each honors the form but adapts ingredients.

**Changedown should aspire to this**—not "a better way to track changes" but "the way intent exists in files."

## The Test

When someone asks:
- "Do you want to use Git?" (infrastructure question)
- "Do you want to use Changedown?" (craft question)

If Changedown succeeds, those become **different questions entirely**.

Git is infrastructure. 
Changedown is **craft**.

The bánh mì test: Does using Changedown feel like choosing between sandwiches, or like choosing to get bánh mì?

If it's the latter, you've achieved escape velocity from the taxonomy.

## Conclusion

Collaboration systems don't prevent entropy—they **surf it**.

Changedown creates temporary negentropy pockets (fresh deliberation), exports stale entropy (VCS compaction), and lets teams find their equilibrium.

The half-life of deliberation is real. The soggy bread problem is real. Heat death is inevitable.

But between those endpoints lies **useful work**—files that carry their intent, teams that understand their decisions, codebases that remember their reasoning.

That's worth building. Even if the Second Law eventually wins.
