# The Format

ChangeDown builds on [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com), a plain-text syntax for editorial markup created by Gabe Weatherhead and Erik Hess in 2013. Five inline constructs cover the full editorial vocabulary[^cn-1.1].

## Syntax

```
Type          Syntax             Example
───────────── ────────────────── ──────────────────
Insertion     {++text++}         {++added this++}
Deletion      {--text--}         {--removed this--}
Substitution  {~~old~>new~~}     {~~before~>after~~}
Highlight     {==text==}         {==highlighted==}
Comment       {>>text<<}         {>>a note<<}
```

Any markdown file with these constructs is a valid CriticMarkup document. ChangeDown adds a metadata layer on top.

## Metadata Levels

**Level 0** — Bare CriticMarkup. No attribution. Just the change.

`{++added this++}`

**Level 1** — Inline metadata appended after the closing delimiter. Author, date, status.

`{++added this++}{>>@claude 2026-03-12 proposed<<}`

**Level 2** — Footnote references linking to full discussion blocks. Author identity, timestamps, status lifecycle, amendment history, and threaded deliberation. This is what the MCP tools produce and what the review panel displays.

```
[^cn-1]: @claude | 2026-03-12 | ins | accepted
    @claude 2026-03-12T14:30:00Z: Added for clarity
    approved: @hackerbara 2026-03-12T15:00:00Z "good addition"
```

{==The footnote block is the deliberation record.==}[^cn-4] It stays with the file — not in a PR comment, not in a Slack thread, not in a separate review system. {~~When someone reads the file six months later, the context is still there.~>When someone reads the file next year, the context is still there.~~}[^cn-1.2]

## Views

Three projections of the same file:

- **Changes** — The working view. Markup rendered as colored inline decorations, delimiters hidden, gutter shows where edits are.
- **Agent** — Everything visible. Raw delimiters, hash coordinates, footnotes. What an AI agent sees when it reads the file.
- **Final** — Clean prose. All accepted changes applied, rejected changes removed. The document as it reads when deliberation is done.

    @ai:claude-opus-4.6 2026-03-13T06:08:30Z: Credit the creators. CriticMarkup is their work — we build on it.
    approved: @human:hackerbara 2026-03-13T06:09:38Z "absolutely — their format, their credit"

[^cn-1.2]: @ai:claude-opus-4.6 | 2026-03-13 | sub | proposed
    @ai:claude-opus-4.6 2026-03-13T06:08:30Z: More grounded phrasing — "next year" is concrete, "six months later" is oddly specific

    @human:hackerbara 2026-03-13T06:09:24Z: this is what we add to CriticMarkup. this paragraph is the whole pitch for L2.
