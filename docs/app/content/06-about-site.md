# About this site

This site implements a minimal browser-based Changedown editor environment, using components of the Changedown Visual Studio Code extension. It is intended as a proof of concept and working lab, and may have bugs! It runs entirely in your browser -- no server, no account, no data leaves your machine. 

Changedown editor enhancements flow through the standard Changedown LSP server, running on a Web Worker process. Pandoc is dynamically loaded from CDN for docx operations.

## Features

- **CriticMarkup change tracking** -- insertions, deletions, substitutions, comments, and highlights, all using the open [CriticMarkup](https://criticmarkup.com/) format
- **Multiple view modes** -- HTML preview + Editor with view-aware change decoration and display
- **Monaco code editor** with syntax-aware decorations for CriticMarkup
- **DOCX import/export** via Pandoc running as WebAssembly -- convert Word documents without uploading them anywhere
- **LSP-powered change detection** running in a web worker for real-time tracking
- **File management** with a virtual filesystem in your browser

## Built with

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) + [Preact Signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/) for reactive UI
- [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for the code editing surface
- [Pandoc WASM](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/pandoc-wasm) for document conversion
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the website shell and SEO
 - [preact-render-to-string](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-render-to-string) for build-time SSR — the native app hydrates a pre-rendered component shell for instant first paint, while the browser build client-renders into an empty container alongside Astro's static SEO article for crawlers
- [CriticMarkup](https://criticmarkup.com/) as the change tracking format
- [Changedown](https://github.com/hackerbara/changedown) core parser, LSP, Monaco bindings, docx processing

## Privacy

Everything runs locally. Your documents never leave your browser. No analytics, no tracking, no server-side processing.
