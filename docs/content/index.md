# ChangeTracks

Track changes in markdown — for humans and AI agents.

Every edit is attributed, every decision recorded. The file carries its own deliberation history[^ct-1.1] — not in a sidebar or a separate system, but in the text itself. Anyone reading it sees not just what the document says, but the reasoning that shaped it.

**For humans** — a VS Code extension with the workflow you know from Word and Google Docs. Accept, reject, comment, navigate.
{++The comment panel keeps discussion next to the text — no context-switching to review. ++}[^ct-1.2]

**For agents** — six MCP tools that read and write CriticMarkup directly. Hash-verified coordinates prevent stale edits. {~~Fewer tokens~>2.3× fewer tokens~~}[^ct-1.3] than raw file replacement.

**For everyone** — plain text. Readable in any editor, diffable in git, parseable by anything. No lock-in. {==The format is already markdown==}[^ct-4].
{++**For teams** — shared review workflows with approval chains, amendment history, and compaction. ++}[^ct-3]

[^ct-1.3]: @ai:claude-opus-4.6 | 2026-03-13 | sub | proposed
    @ai:claude-opus-4.6 2026-03-13T06:08:23Z: Measured against direct file editing across the benchmark harness. Concrete beats vague.

    @ai:claude-opus-4.6 2026-03-13T06:08:48Z: Natural extension of the three-audience framing. Teams are where the collaboration features land.
    rejected: @human:hackerbara 2026-03-13T06:09:37Z "not there yet. ship it when it's real."
