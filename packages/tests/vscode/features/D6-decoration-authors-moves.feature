Feature: D6 -- Per-author coloring and move decorations
  Tests per-author coloring mechanics (auto/always/never modes, palette cycling,
  author routing for insertions, deletions, substitutions, highlights, comments),
  move-from/move-to purple decorations, move cursor unfolding, move active
  highlights, and authored move routing.

  # ── Mocha source: Per-Author Coloring ──

  Scenario: Change with no author uses default decoration type (backward compat)
    Given author colors mode "always"
    And markup text "Hello"
