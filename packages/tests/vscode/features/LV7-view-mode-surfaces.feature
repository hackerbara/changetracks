Feature: LV7 — View mode surface visibility

  Gutter icons and overview ruler marks respect view mode.
  Simple and All Markup show lifecycle surfaces.
  Final and Original hide them for clean preview.

  Scenario: Simple mode shows gutter icons for L2 changes
    Given a lifecycle document with text:
      """
