Feature: D9 -- Show Delimiters behavior matrix
  The showDelimiters setting controls delimiter and footnote reference visibility
  with view-mode-specific behavior:

  - Working + Delimiters OFF (default): Type decorations on contentRange, delimiters hidden, NO cursor unfolding
  - Working + Delimiters ON: Full static markup (delimiters + refs visible), no cursor tricks
  - Simple + Delimiters OFF: Clean text, delimiters always hidden, NO cursor unfolding
  - Simple + Delimiters ON: Delimiters hidden, but cursor entering CONTENT range reveals them

  The trigger zone for cursor unfolding uses contentRange (not fullRange), so
  cursor on delimiter characters does NOT trigger unfolding.

  # ── Working + Delimiters OFF: type decorations always applied, no unfolding ──

  Scenario: Working + Delimiters OFF + cursor in content: delimiters stay hidden
    Given markup text "Hello {++world++} end"
    When I decorate in working mode with showDelimiters off and cursor at 0:10
    Then insertions count is 1
    And insertions has range 0:9 to 0:14
    And hiddens count is 2
    And hiddens has range 0:6 to 0:9
    And hiddens has range 0:14 to 0:17
    And unfolded is empty

  Scenario: Working + Delimiters OFF + no cursor: type decorations still applied
    Given markup text "Hello {++world++} end"
    When I decorate in working mode with showDelimiters off
