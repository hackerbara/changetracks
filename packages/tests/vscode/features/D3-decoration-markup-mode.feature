Feature: D3 -- Decoration rendering in all-markup mode
  Tests that EditorDecorator applies correct decoration ranges when
  showMarkup=true (all-markup view). Covers all 5 change types, multi-line,
  empty content, mixed types, special characters, stress tests, decoration
  style modes (foreground vs background), character-level sidecar decorations,
  final view mode, and original view mode.
