Feature: Agent Content Decorations - Footnoted Changes
  EditorDecorator correctly renders agent-created CriticMarkup that
  includes footnote references [^cn-N]. The parser extends node.range
  to include the trailing footnote reference while contentRange stays
  unchanged. The decorator splits the footnote reference portion into
  settledRefs (gray metadata styling), so type-colored decorations
  cover only the CriticMarkup content. This affects markup mode ranges,
  smart view hiding, and cursor-aware unfolding.

  # ─── Markup Mode with Footnotes ──────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Agent insertion fullRange includes footnote ref
    Given markup text "Hello {++world++}[^cn-1] end"
    When I decorate in markup mode
    Then insertions count is 1
    And insertions has range 0:6 to 0:17
    And hiddens is empty
    And unfolded is empty

  Scenario: Footnote ref is NOT decorated as a separate change
    Given markup text "Hello {++world++}[^cn-1] end"
    When I decorate in markup mode
    Then the parser finds 1 change in the decoration text
    And parsed change 1 is type Insertion

  Scenario: Agent deletion fullRange includes footnote ref
    Given markup text "{--removed--}[^cn-1] rest"
    When I decorate in markup mode
    Then deletions count is 1
    And deletions has range 0:0 to 0:13

  # ─── Substitution with Footnotes ─────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Agent substitution original and modified ranges
    Given markup text "{~~old~>new~~}[^cn-2] rest"
    When I decorate in markup mode
    Then substitutionOriginals count is 1
    And substitutionModifieds count is 1
    And substitutionOriginals has range 0:0 to 0:8
    And substitutionModifieds has range 0:8 to 0:14
    And hiddens is empty

  Scenario: Substitution footnote ref does not affect sub-ranges
    Given the input text is:
      """
      {~~old~>new~~}[^cn-2] rest
      """
    When I parse the text
    Then the parser finds 1 change
    And change 1 is a substitution
    And change 1 original range starts at 3
    And change 1 original range ends at 6
    And change 1 modified range starts at 8
    And change 1 modified range ends at 11
    And change 1 range ends at 21

  # ─── Smart View Hides Delimiters and Footnote References ─────────
