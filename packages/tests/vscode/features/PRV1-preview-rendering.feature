Feature: PRV1 — Preview HTML rendering from CriticMarkup

  Tests that buildReplacements() and related preview helpers correctly convert
  CriticMarkup source text into styled HTML for the VS Code markdown preview.

  # ── Basic CriticMarkup replacement ──────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Insertion replaced with <ins> tag
    Given preview source text "Hello {++world++} there"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "<ins class=\"cn-ins cn-proposed\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-6\" data-change-id=\"cn-1\">world</ins>"
    And the preview HTML does not contain "{++"

  Scenario: Deletion replaced with <del> tag
    Given preview source text "Hello {--world--} there"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "<del class=\"cn-del cn-proposed\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-6\" data-change-id=\"cn-1\">world</del>"
    And the preview HTML does not contain "{--"

  Scenario: Substitution replaced with <del> + <ins>
    Given preview source text "Hello {~~old~>new~~} there"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "<del class=\"cn-sub-del cn-proposed\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-6\" data-change-id=\"cn-1\">old</del>"
    And the preview HTML contains "<ins class=\"cn-sub-ins cn-proposed\">new</ins>"

  Scenario: Highlight replaced with <mark> tag
    Given preview source text "Hello {==important==} there"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "<mark class=\"cn-hl\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-6\" data-change-id=\"cn-1\">important</mark>"

  Scenario: Comment replaced with tooltip span
    Given preview source text "Hello{>>a note<<} there"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "class=\"cn-comment\""
    And the preview HTML contains "title=\"a note\""

  Scenario: Comments hidden when showComments is false
    Given preview source text "Hello{>>a note<<} there"
    And preview option showComments is false
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML does not contain "cn-comment"
    And the preview HTML does not contain "{>>"

  # ── Multiple changes — reverse-order replacement ────────────────────

  Scenario: Multiple changes preserve offsets
    Given preview source text "A {++B++} C {--D--} E"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "<ins class=\"cn-ins cn-proposed\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-2\" data-change-id=\"cn-1\">B</ins>"
    And the preview HTML contains "<del class=\"cn-del cn-proposed\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-12\" data-change-id=\"cn-2\">D</del>"
    And the preview HTML starts with "A "
    And the preview HTML ends with " E"

  # ── Code fence exclusion zones ──────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: findFenceZones identifies fenced regions
    Given preview source text:
      """
      before
      ```js
      code
      ```
      after
      """
    When I find fence zones
    Then 1 fence zone is found
    And fence zone 1 starts at or before the first code fence
    And fence zone 1 ends at or after the last code fence

  Scenario: CriticMarkup inside code fences is preserved
    Given preview source text:
      """
      Real {++change++}
      ```js
      {++not a change++}
      ```

      """
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "<ins class=\"cn-ins cn-proposed\" data-cn-pair=\"cn-pair-5\" data-change-id=\"cn-1\">change</ins>"
    And the preview HTML contains "{++not a change++}"

  Scenario: Multiple fence zones detected
    Given preview source text:
      """
      ```
      a
      ```
      {++real++}
      ```

      """
    When I find fence zones
    Then 2 fence zones are found

  # ── HTML escaping ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: HTML in change content is escaped
    Given preview source text "{++<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>++}"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML does not contain "<script>"
    And the preview HTML contains "&lt;script&gt;"

  Scenario: HTML in comment title attribute is escaped
    Given preview source text "{>>say \"hello\" & goodbye<<}"
    When I build preview replacements
    Then the preview HTML contains "&quot;"
    And the preview HTML contains "&amp;"

  # ── Footnote refs ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
