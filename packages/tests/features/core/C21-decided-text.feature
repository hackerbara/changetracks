@core @committed-text
Feature: C21 - Committed Text View
  The committed-text module computes a "decided view" of CriticMarkup documents.
  Per-line: accepted changes are applied, pending/unknown changes are reverted,
  rejected changes are reverted (no flag), highlights show content, comments removed.
  Document-level: parses footnotes, excludes footnote definitions, computes hashes,
  builds bidirectional line mapping, and formats output with headers and flags.

  Background:
    Given the committed-text hashline module is initialized
